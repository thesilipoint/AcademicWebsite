I am Silica Kole. I chose Technical Teaching as a Career at the age of 24, right after my Master of Technology in Computer Science Engineering. Currently, I am working as an Assistant Professor at a prominent Engineering College in New Delhi, India.

In my 8 years of a teaching career, I have had the opportunity to teach and interact with more than 1500 undergrad students. 

I have worked on several Computer Engineering based Projects on Topics like Image Processing, Network Security, Computer Networks, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. 

I have published a few Research Papers in some prominent International Journals. What I like most about my job is the chance to keep up with Technology and the Interaction with bright young minds. 

I am planning to start my Ph.D. soon in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am available to take up roles as a Research Associate or Teaching Assistant at any Prominent Global University. 

My strengths are Honesty, Diligence, Curiosity, and the love for Science.
